# Docker

## What is Docker?
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package an application and all its dependencies, ensuring that it runs consistently in any environment.

## Key Concepts
### Image: 
A lightweight, stand-alone, and executable software package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.
### Container:
A runnable instance of an image. Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.
### Dockerfile:
A text file with instructions on how to build a Docker image.

### Docker Hub:
A cloud-based registry service where Docker images are stored and shared.

### Installation
To install Docker, follow the official Docker installation guide for your operating system: Docker Installation

## Basic Docker Commands
docker version: Check the Docker version installed.

```
docker version
```

docker pull: Download an image from Docker Hub.

```

docker pull ubuntu

```

docker images: List all images on your local system.

```

docker images

```
docker run: Run a container from an image.

```

docker run ubuntu

```
docker ps: List running containers.

```
docker ps

```
docker ps -a: List all containers, including stopped ones.

```
docker ps -a

```
docker stop: Stop a running container.

```
docker stop <container_id>

```

docker rm: Remove a stopped container.


```

docker rm <container_id>

```
docker rmi: Remove an image.

```
docker rmi <image_id>

```

# Writing a Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image.

## Example Dockerfile for a simple Python application:

```
# Use the official Python image from the Docker Hub
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the requirements.txt file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install any dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Specify the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]


```

## Building and Running a Docker Image
### docker build: 

Build an image from a Dockerfile.

```

docker build -t my-python-app .

```

docker run:
Run a container from the built image.

```

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 my-python-app

```

## Docker Compose
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a docker-compose.yml file to configure your application's services.

Example docker-compose.yml:

```

version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: my-python-app
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"


```

## Docker Compose Commands

docker-compose up: Build and start containers.

```
docker-compose up

```

docker-compose down: Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes.

```

docker-compose down

```

docker-compose ps: List containers.

```

docker-compose ps

```
## Networking in Docker

docker network create: Create a new network.

```

docker network create my-network

```

docker network ls: List all networks.

```

docker network ls

```

docker network inspect: Inspect a network.

```

docker network inspect my-network

```
docker network connect: Connect a container to a network.

```

docker network connect my-network my-container

```

docker network disconnect: Disconnect a container from a network.

```

docker network disconnect my-network my-container

```

## Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are used to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers.

docker volume create: Create a new volume.


```
docker volume create my-volume

```

docker volume ls: List all volumes.


```
docker volume ls

```

docker volume inspect: Inspect a volume.


```
docker volume inspect my-volume

```

docker volume rm: Remove a volume.


```

docker volume rm my-volume

```
